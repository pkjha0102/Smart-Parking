# Smart-Parking
This is simple arduino based vehicle parking automation.
In this project, I have explained and executed the idea of vehicle parking automation using arduino and LCD monitor. A monitor on the entrance of parking arena will display the real time situation of occupied and vacant parking slots. 
If there are any vacant slots then only any vehicle will be allowed to entre. Entry and exit of vehicles is controlled by a barrier on the entrance which read data from the slots of parking.
